Congratulations! You've completed training. 

Now we want to see if the knowledge you gained will help you on another task.

On each trial, you will be presented with the cards you were shown earlier in the experiment
and will be asked to select which weather pattern they predict. 

Use the training you just completed to help you make the correct choice.

Unlike training, you will not receive any feedback.
