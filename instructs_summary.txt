Recall, your task is to learn, using the geometric cues, 
which cues predict which weather pattern.
When you first start, you won't know how the cues predict the weather pattern. 
Your goal is to learn how to predict the cues. You will be tested 
later in the experiment. To help you gauge your 
performance, at the end of each block (4 total) you will be told how accurate you were 
(i.e., your percent correct). Your goal is to increase your accuracy to 100% correct.




The experimenter will review the instructions and answer any questions 
you may have. Please do not hesitate to ask questions - these 
instructions are complicated and questions are expected.
