At the beginning of each trial, you will be shown an image similar to the examplesyou just saw. At this point, you should respond by selecting with your mouseone of the weather patters, either sun or rain. You should respond as accurately as possible and you will have up to a 60 secondsto make your response. As soon as you respond, the image will disappear, and you will be given feedback. If your response was correct, you will hear a high-pitched tone and see the word "CORRECT" along with name of the weather you selected.  Press the space bar to see an example of correct feedback.
